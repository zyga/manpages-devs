This repository contains manual pages about particular Free and Open Source
Software developers. This is a bit of a crazy experiment but could be actually
useful for historians analyzing IRC logs or archived commit messages.

This repository is free-for-all, please feel free to open pull requests with
new manual pages for particular people. As a personal preference the pages are
written using `mandoc` package.
